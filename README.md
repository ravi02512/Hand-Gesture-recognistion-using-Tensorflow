# Hand-Gesture-recognistion-using-Tensorflow

## Description:
  Built classifier classifier which can recognise the 10 kind of hand signs you also can see the variance reduction of model from 28 percent to 6 percent after tunnnig the hyperparameters and variance reduction techniques 
  
## Language of Implemetation and Framework used:
  The whole code is written in Python and Tensorflow which is one of popular Deep learning frame out there is used.
  
## About the dataset.
The dataset is in HDF5 format which is used for storing the numerical data.Here we have two data file first is train_signs.h5 which contains the 1080 training image data and second is test_signs.h5 which contain the numerical data of 120 test images.

## Dependencies used:
### math
  For basic mathematical computation.
### numpy
  Used for algebric calcuations

### h5py
  Used for accessing the HDF5 file format.

### matplotlib
  Used for visualizing the data.

### tensorflow
  Used for building and optimizing the neural network.
  
  
### Important steps in nural network 
 
 1.Intialize Parameters.
 
 2.Forward Propagation.
 
 3.Compute cost.
 
 4.Backward Popagation ( Optimization algortims like Adam and RMS prop)
 
 Above are the 4 most important steps which involves in each and every nural network you can run these four steps over 100 or 1000 times in order to achieve the better accuracy.
 
 In this repository the Adam optizer is used for bettter accuracy.
